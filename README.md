# Instant Gratification (KAGGLE competition)


I entered the Instant Gratification competition when it was 16 days to go. After going through several Kernels and Discussions I listed the following properties of the data set:

- Data seemed to be generated by groups corresponding to the column wheezy-copper-turtle-magic (https://www.kaggle.com/c/instant-gratification/discussion/92930#latest-541375)
- Inside these groups features with low variance supposed to be unimportant (https://www.kaggle.com/fchmiel/low-variance-features-useless/)
-
