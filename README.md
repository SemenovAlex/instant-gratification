# Instant Gratification (KAGGLE competition)


I entered the Instant Gratification competition when it was 16 days to go. After going through several Kernels and Discussions I listed the following properties of the data set:

- Data seemed to be generated by groups corresponding to the column wheezy-copper-turtle-magic (https://www.kaggle.com/c/instant-gratification/discussion/92930#latest-541375)
- Inside these groups features with low variance supposed to be unimportant (https://www.kaggle.com/fchmiel/low-variance-features-useless/)
- QDA is a good modelling approach for this case (https://www.kaggle.com/speedwagon/quadratic-discriminant-analysis)
- Data probably was generated with make_classification function (https://www.kaggle.com/mhviraf/synthetic-data-for-next-instant-gratification)
- Due to adversarial validation test and train sets are of the same nature (https://www.kaggle.com/h4211819/adversarial-validation)

use hints from Dont Overfit II 

By using 2*Xcenter - X ,I make a new dataset , because I read the source code of makeclassfication, it brings a 0.002 auc boostâ€¦
